this blog contains the following:

what is fuckifier anyways?
where can i get fuckifier?
whats the difference between fucker and fuckifier?
and
developer advantages with the soon-to-be-released fuckifier api :D

# what is fuckifier anyways?

fuckifier is a python program where you can encode/encrypt text into a mess, and decode it.
most of the time decoding doesn't work so try help on the project my giving pull req :)

# where can i get fuckifier?
get fuckifier from the github:
https://github.com/text2hex/fuckifier

i'll add more download places soon <3

# whats the difference between fucker and fuckifier?
fucker uses an older way to convert text, and uses tkinter, which makes it look outdated and overall pretty ugly imo.
fuckifier uses customtkinter, and a custom-made conversion method. also uses a custom theme for customtkinter.

# developer advantages with the soon-to-be-released fuckifier api :D

yup, i'm making an API for this. also for text2hex eventually but idk when :loudly-crying-face
you'll have access to:
discord advantages like making a bot that can do it/webhooks to make it print whenever someone converts
a web api in javascript so you can integrate it into your website or anything
and also will be installable as a module so it's easier if you wanna try recreate this or anything

# legal disclaimers for anyone redistributing / recreating

you MUST include the notice in tkinter --> customtkinter's folder and drag it to the root if your redistributing/recreating.
you MUST have a readme that says either "Created by" or "Inspired by" text2hex or epicinver and leave a link to the repo.

bye bye and have fun making scrambled fuckery



alright bye
